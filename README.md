# Ploblem Specification
You are a CEO of an AI company which builds and sells AI software to different types of clients. A client of yours is Maha, a Physiotherapist who helps people build customized rehabilitation plans that fits their health conditions and abilities. Maha told you that it takes her a long time to build rehabilitation exercise plans for her customers since it varies according to the customer Age Category, Condition and No. of Exercises. So, she decided to reach out to your company to see if AI can make her job easier. You told her that she is lucky since this is a common AI problem, known as optimization, and you can help her by building a Genetic algorithm solution.

# Tools

* Python Random library.
* Python NumPy library.
* Python Pandas library.
* Python matplotlib library.
* Spyder IDE.
* Microsoft Word.

# Delivables

The code should work as follows; the user enters Age Category (options include Adult and Child), Condition Type (options include Stroke, Spinal cord, and Brain injuries) and No. of Exercises (number of different exercises to be performed per body part). Your GA will then run to find the best rehabilitation exercise(s) that maximize your fitness function and output a complete plan for each body parts (elbow, upper arm, knee/lower leg and wrist). Each main rehabilitation plan should contain at least one exercise for (elbow, upper arm, and knee/lower leg) and a maximum of two exercises, while the wrist may contain no exercise or up to one exercise per plan.

# Code WorkFlow

1. Take inputs from user and avoiding user.
2. Apply Genatic Algoithm using these hyper-parameters:

	* Num of individuals :	30
	* Num of weights :	 3
	* Crossover rate :	0.7
	* Mutation rate : 	0.2

4. Print user reportt.
